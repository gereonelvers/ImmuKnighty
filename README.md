# ImmuKnighty
This is the GitHub-Repository for the MIT COVID19 Challenge Hackathon project 'ImmuKnighty'.
Our goal is to support front line health care and emergency service workers by building a platform that identifies immune or low-risk employees and helps administrators prioritize testing and PPE supplies.
